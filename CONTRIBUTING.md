## Level of Support

This project is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.
However, the project is under active development at the National Land Survey of Finlad (NLS) and we 
provide limited support for it.
- We will read the bug reports and enhancement suggestions which are filed as
[Issues](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues) and post comments on them.
- We will review and comment the Pull Requests. Accepted Pull Requests will be merged.
- We can be contacted privately by sending email to <os@nls.fi>

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues) that
might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification,
you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues/new).
Please provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

If you have a question that you don't want to become public, you can send it by email
to <os@nls.fi>.

## Reporting Bugs

Before you report a bug, search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues) and check if your problem
is already reported. If the bug is new:
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps 
that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues). Check the existing
feature requests and if your idea appears to be new:
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi/issues/new).
- Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.

## Reporting Security Issues

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including
sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.
Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <os@nls.fi>.

## I Want To Make a Pull Request

If you want to help the project with a code contribution, please open a Pull Request
with your proposed changes. Your Pull Request will be reviewed and a maintainer may
